            <td>The lockBit ransomware group is described in detail by CISA's advisory to understand their operational activity and objectives better. The document outlines how LockBit operates, how the ransomware group delivers it, how they leverage superior encryption tools, and how they compel victims to pay them because they threaten to release the stolen information. The framework offers practical advice to organizations and offers a set of security recommendations to guard against attacks, identify early caution indicators, and react promptly to threats. The advisory focuses on the necessity of an organizational and comprehensive approach as the most effective way to prevent oneself from becoming a victim of LockBit and other ransomware.</td>
