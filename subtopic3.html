            <td>This article in the Wall Street Journal explores the significant cybersecurity risks posed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in connection with large-scale events, such as presidential elections in the United States. Lin explains how APT groups go for objectives such as the electoral systems to demoralize the public or sabotage the election process. Measures employed by cybersecurity agencies to counteract such sophisticated attacks are still described. Other measures include surveillance, system hardening, and constant monitoring of threats in real-time. This brings out that there will always be expectations of attacks, especially times that may be viewed as very important, hence the need to ensure that an organization is safe from such trolls.</td>

            <td>This article focuses on cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the food and agriculture sector, particularly concerning APTs. It heralds several cases of how hackers, particularly those with malicious intent, were able to attack and compromise sensitive supply chains, which are crucial for food production and delivery. To support this, the author analyses the reasons for sector vulnerabilities, including its outdated infrastructure, insufficient cybersecurity expenditure, and growing threat landscape. The piece recommends industry-specific approaches to security that state that large-scale disruptions of this industry are not conducive to public health. It focuses on cooperation between companies' executives and cybersecurity specialists to enhance protection.</td>
